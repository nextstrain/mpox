"""
This part of the workflow handles fetching sequences from various sources.
Uses `config.sources` to determine which sequences to include in final output.

Currently only fetches sequences from GenBank, but other sources can be
defined in the config. If adding other sources, add a new rule upstream
of rule `fetch_all_sequences` to create the file `data/{source}.ndjson` or the
file must exist as a static file in the repo.

Produces final output as

    sequences_ndjson = "data/sequences.ndjson"
