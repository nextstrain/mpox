# Nextclade reference tree workflow for monkeypox

This README doesn't end up in the datasets, so it's a developer README, rather than a dataset user README.

## Usage

```bash
snakemake
```

You need to have a `nextclade3` binary in your path. It's in the `nextstrain/docker-base` image or you can get it from <https://github.com/nextstrain/nextclade/releases/tag/3.0.0-alpha.0>.

### Visualize results

View results with:

```bash
nextstrain view auspice/
```

## Maintenance

### Updating for new clades

- [ ] Update each `config/{build}/clades.tsv` with new clades
- [ ] Add new clades to color ordering
- [ ] Add representative sequences to `resources/include_accessions.txt`
- [ ] Check that clades look good, exclude problematic sequences as necessary

### Creating a new dataset version

- [ ] Edit CHANGELOG.md
- [ ] Switch to `nextclade_data/data/mpox` repo
- [ ] Create branch there, copy datasets, commit, push, open PR:

```bash
cd ~/code
cp mpox/nextclade/datasets/all-clades/tree.json nextclade_data/data/nextstrain/mpox/all-clades/tree.json
cp mpox/nextclade/datasets/clade-iib/tree.json nextclade_data/data/nextstrain/mpox/clade-iib/tree.json
cp mpox/nextclade/datasets/clade-i/tree.json nextclade_data/data/nextstrain/mpox/clade-i/tree.json
cp mpox/nextclade/datasets/lineage-b.1/tree.json nextclade_data/data/nextstrain/mpox/lineage-b.1/tree.json
```

## Configuration

Builds differ in paths, relevant configs are pulled in through lookup.

## Installation
