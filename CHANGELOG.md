# CHANGELOG

We use this CHANGELOG to document breaking changes, new features, bug fixes,
and config value changes that may affect both the usage of the workflows and
the outputs of the workflows.

Changes for this project _do not_ currently follow the [Semantic Versioning rules](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
Instead, changes appear below grouped by the date they were added to the workflow.
