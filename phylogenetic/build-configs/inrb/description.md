### Laboratories involved in genomic surveillance of mpox in the DRC
Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale (INRB) through :
* Pathogen Genomics Laboratory, Epidemiology and Global Health Department, INRB, Kinshasa
* Rodolphe Merieux INRB Goma Laboratory, Goma
* Mpox National Reference Laboratory, Virology Department, INRB, Kinshasa

### Genomic surveillance of mpox in the DRC
This work is made possible by the open sharing of genetic data among research groups and constitutes a part of the genomic surveillance of mpox in the DRC, led by the Ministry of Public Health, Hygiene and Prevention through INRB, DSE, PNLFHMPX and INSP. The provincial health divisions and health zones affected by the mpox outbreak are also involved in genomic surveillance efforts.

Data will be shared via virological.org and [Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org/) , and will be continuously updated as new mpox sequences are generated . If you intend to use these sequences before their publication, please contact Profs.  Placide Mbala and Steve Ahuka for request and coordination.

### Partner institutions
* These sequences were generated by the Pathogen Genomics Laboratory at INRB in the DRC in partnership with :
* Africa-CDC/ASLM
* AFROSCREEN consortium
* Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp, Belgium
* ARCTIC Network
* Biosurv international, UK
* TransVIHMI :Université de Montpellier, Institut de Recherche pour le Développement (IRD), Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale (INSERM) ;  Montpellier ;  France,
* UCLA
* USDA
* WHO
