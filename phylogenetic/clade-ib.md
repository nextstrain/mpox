Alignment against oldest clade I sequence KJ642613 Congo_8

SNP C13556T might be real, appears in sequences from both INRB and Erasmus

T17969C -> right next to stretch of Ns, might be artefact

15689, maybe real

20265,20267, 20268 are inconsistently called

77873 incorrectly called reference in 2 RDC-NKV-GOM sequences
