# Nextstrain repository for mpox virus

This repository contains three workflows for the analysis of mpox virus (MPXV) data:

- `ingest/` - Download data from GenBank, clean and curate it and upload it to S3
- `phylogenetics/` - Make phylogenetic trees for nextstrain.org
- `nextclade/` - Make Nextclade datasets

Each folder contains a README with more information.
